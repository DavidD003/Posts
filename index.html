This site is a place for me to share. Started in 2022, feeling inspired by the power of so many free tools and platforms available for use like fastai, huggingfacespaces, and Github pages which power this page. Intent is to note down some lessons learned in the event they might be of use.

[My Coding Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr8HDUNoTaT2QIfLktXk3Jg), with code walkthroughs ans demos.
[My Music Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgK0vLKlhGC573IbH2HL6kw), mostly The Lumineers covers.
[My Github](https://github.com/DavidD003), where my work can be accessed.
