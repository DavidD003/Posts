This site is a place for me to share. Started in 2022, feeling inspired by the power of so many tools and platforms available for use like fastai, huggingfacespaces, and Github pages, which powers this page.

[My Coding Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCr8HDUNoTaT2QIfLktXk3Jg), with code walkthroughs and demos.

[My Music Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCgK0vLKlhGC573IbH2HL6kw), mostly The Lumineers covers.

[My Github](https://github.com/DavidD003), where my work can be accessed.
